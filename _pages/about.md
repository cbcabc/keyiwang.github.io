I'm _Keyi Wang(In English)/おうかきつ(In Japanese)/왕커이(In Korean)_, a second-year master student supervised by [Prof.Jinping Sun](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/sunjinping/zh_CN/index/136932/list/index.htm) in [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). My current research interest lies in communication networks and wireless communication. Previously, I obtained my B.Eng from [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://sice.bupt.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/).<br/>
For more details, please turn to CV or see [CV.pdf](/keyiwang.github.io/files/KeyiWang_Resume.pdf). I'm now seeking for Ph.D in _satellite communication/unmanned systems/communication networks/…_. If you are interested in me, just drop me an email.
